The Hyroes Child Theme is a custom child theme built on [Hello Elementor](https://wordpress.org/themes/hello-elementor/) for https://hyroes.com.

== Description ==

The Hyroes Child Theme is a lightweight and minimalist WordPress theme built specifically for https://hyroes.com. Based on Hello Elementor, it provides seamless integration with the Elementor page builder plugin while maintaining the custom branding and functionality needed for the Hyroes website.

This theme is optimized for speed and performance, providing a solid foundation for building unique designs using the Elementor drag-and-drop site builder. It maintains all the flexibility of Hello Elementor while incorporating Hyroes-specific customizations.

The theme supports common WordPress features which can be extended using a child-theme. In addition, there are several ways to add custom styles. It can be done from **Elementor**, from the WordPress customizer, using a child-theme, or with an external plugin. To customize the theme further, visit [Elementor developers docs](https://developers.elementor.com/docs/hello-elementor-theme/).

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the 'Add New' button.
2. Click 'Upload theme' and upload the zipped child.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
4. Navigate to Elementor and start building your site.
